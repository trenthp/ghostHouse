# 🎃 Halloween Ghost House AR - Project Summary

## What We Built

A complete **WebXR Augmented Reality experience** that displays 3D ghosts flying around your Halloween house when you view the location through your phone's camera. Kids can tap to scare ghosts, build combos, and compete for high scores - all while celebrating Halloween at a specific address!

## Key Features Implemented

### 🌍 Geolocation System
- GPS-based detection of proximity to target house
- 50-meter radius activation zone
- Automatic ghosts appear/disappear based on location

### 👻 3D Ghost Models
- Custom-designed 3D ghosts with:
  - Glowing red eyes (emissive material)
  - Ghostly white body with transparency
  - Aura effect that pulses when scared
  - Smooth animations and floating behavior
- Multiple ghosts spawning continuously
- Ghost capacity management (max 15 at a time)

### 🎮 Interactive Gameplay
- **Tap to Scare**: Click/tap ghosts to scare them away

- **Stats Dashboard**: Real-time display of:
  - Total scares
  - Current combo
